=== Notable Bugs === 
â€¢ The great bug of early March
	Issues: fundamental NN structure is broken after implementation (mainly backprop)
	Status: FIXED (3/15/2020, after ~1 week)
	Details:
	- A debugger that set all negative ReLu outputs to 0 was not removed and keep the code more broken
	* Derivatives of ReLu was incorrect: cases where Z == 0 must be 0 instead of 1 (i.e. 0-setter filter should be Z <= 0 instead of Z < 0)
	- Gradient checking needs to check with original W, b and randomized b, not only W
